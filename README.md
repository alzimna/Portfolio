# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Alzimna Badril Umam. In 2025, when this portfolio was created, I was a fresh graduate of the Master's program in Mathematics at UGM. During my undergraduate studies at the same university, I concentrated on analysis with expertise in topology and functional analysis. After graduating, coinciding with COVID, I took several data science classes and deepened my programming skills in Python through HackerRank and Codeforces. This helped me recognize my talents; in addition to theoretical mathematics, I also felt excited when I could translate algorithms into code.

This portfolio is a collection of my assignments during my Master's studies at UGM. I chose to concentrate in the field of statistics, and most of the assignments used real-world data. All projects, except for "Stock Price Prediction with Sentiment Analysis," are my projects for the Multivariate Analysis course and utilize the book "Method of Multivariate Analysis" by ALVIN C. RENCHER. I aim to show that theoretical statistics can also be realized in code form, making it applicable to real data. On the other hand, this also implies that the packages available in the R and Python programming languages also implement statistical theories behind them.

So, enjoy the food !
